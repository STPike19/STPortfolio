		I'll have you know that I was voted so by the Council of Simons (of which I am the president, vice president, secretary of Simon and treasurer).
		As for my abilities, I can hold my breath for 20 minutes, tame tigers with my sheer awesomeness, and crush entire nations just by flexing. Don't worry though.
		I am a friend to all, unless you think you're cooler than me. For those here because they like cool dudes, you've come to the right place.
		For those here who are my computer science teacher, who has to give this website a grade, I'm sorry.  Regardless, I leave you with a quote.
